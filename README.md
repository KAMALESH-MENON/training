## Week 3

### From Training
This week, I have learned about:
- **CRUD operations for REST API**: Implemented Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations in two problem statements, Product Management System (PS1) and Order Processing System (PS2).
- **Pydantic Models**:
  - **Type Validation**: Automatically checks that the input matches the declared types.
  - **Error Handling**: If the data doesn't match the expected format, Pydantic raises a `ValidationError`.
- **HTTP Status Codes**:
  - Indicate the outcome of an HTTP request and are grouped into five classes: Informational responses (100 – 199), Successful responses (200 – 299), Redirection messages (300 – 399), Client error responses (400 – 499), and Server error responses (500 – 599).
  - HTTP Exception is used to handle errors by raising exceptions with specific HTTP status codes and messages in FastAPI.
  - Implemented HTTP exceptions in PS1 (Problem Statement 1) and PS2.
- **SQLAlchemy**:
  - Python library for working with databases.
  - Maps Python classes to database tables:
    - **Engine**: Connects SQLAlchemy to the database.
    - **Session**: Manages transactions and database interactions.
    - **Declarative Base**: Defines tables as Python classes.
- **Generators**: Functions that yield values using the `yield` keyword, enabling memory-efficient iteration.
- **Requests Library**: For making HTTP requests to APIs.
- **Inheritance**: When a class derives properties and methods from a parent class.

### Worked on the final assessment problem statement
